Supply Chain Price Prediction System:- Project Overview;- The Supply Chain Price Prediction System is an AI-driven web application designed to provide real-time price predictions for various agricultural products, including vegetables and fruits. This project aims to help farmers, retailers, and consumers make informed decisions based on predictive analytics. The application utilizes machine learning models trained on historical price data and incorporates external factors such as weather conditions and social media sentiment. Users can select a city and vegetable to receive accurate price predictions and insights, supported by a visual representation of trends through graphs and word clouds derived from social media data.

Key Features:-

Real-time Price Predictions: Users can select a city and vegetable to get predictions on future prices. Interactive Graphs: Visual representation of price trends over time. Word Cloud Analysis: Insights derived from social media sentiment related to the selected vegetable. Responsive Design: Modern and user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

Technology Stack:-

Backend: Flask (Python) Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js Machine Learning: Scikit-learn for price prediction Data Sources: Government datasets for historical pricing, Twitter API for sentiment analysis
